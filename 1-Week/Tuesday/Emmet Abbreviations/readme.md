Welcome to the Emmet fireside for Boise Code Work's full stack immersive program on emmet abbreviations and css parallax images. We use the emmet documentation - https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/ - in order to learn how to write all of the html for the body of this project in just one line. We also use the background-attached css property on our background images to generate a parallax affect. You can check out the final product of this short lesson here - https://github.com/BoiseCodeWorks/FS-Wk2-D1.git
